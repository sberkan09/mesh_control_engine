# M-OPENWORLD — Open-world game kit (milestone record)

**Status:** planned, high priority (added 2026-10-17 at Sami's request; no Linear issues yet: check the free limit, otherwise this record is the tracker).
Source: `assessments/gta-benzeri-oyun-fizibilitesi-2026-10-17.md`. Goal: close the gaps between today's engine and a GTA-style small open world (1–2 km², driving, on-foot combat, traffic, pedestrians, police chase, a few missions). A GTA 5 clone project starts after this milestone.

**Why.** Terrain, streaming, vehicles, character, AI, audio and script exist. What is missing is the open-world layer: measured performance at city density, large-world precision, city LOD, road/traffic/pedestrian systems, enter/exit vehicles, weapons and damage, wanted/police, and open-licence content.

**Not in scope:** ray tracing, virtual geometry, destruction, cloth/hair, interiors beyond streamed scenes, multiplayer for this kit.

## Tracks (disjoint modules; run in parallel)

| Track | Steps | Modules | Model | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Scale | A1 city stress scene + `perf_run` budgets on real GPU where available, A2 floating origin / rebase (Opus plan first), A3 HLOD + impostors + building batching, A4 streaming of render LOD per chunk | render, scene/streaming, terrain | Opus (render, perf) | — |
| B. Traffic and crowds | B1 road graph asset (`.mcroads`: lanes, junctions, signals) + editor/MCP authoring, B2 traffic cars on `VehicleDriver3D` (lane follow, yield, signals), B3 pedestrian crowds (sidewalks, BT-cheap LOD, spawn/despawn around focus) | kit, ai | Opus for design, Sonnet implements | — |
| C. Gameplay kit | C1 enter/exit vehicles and seat logic, C2 weapons, projectiles/hitscan, health and damage, hit reactions (ragdoll), C3 wanted level + police BT (algı + tokens), C4 mission/objective components over Luau, minimap and map UI (`.mcui`) | kit, ai, ui | Sonnet (Opus review for core) | — |
| D. Content | D1 M-IMPORT3D (FBX via ufbx, OBJ, glTF gaps), D2 open-licence content catalogue (CC0/CC-BY only: Kenney, Quaternius, Poly Haven, OpenGameArt, ambientCG) with a licence ledger and cook scripts, D3 humanoid retarget (clips onto the engine's skeleton) | asset/cook, tools | Sonnet | — |
| E. Integration | E1 `samples/09_openworld`: 1 km² slice using A–D, gates in `local_ci.sh` (replay hash, budget counters) | samples | Opus | after A–D |

Dependencies: C and B1 need nothing from A. B2/B3 need B1. C3 needs C2 and B3. E needs all. D1 first for fastest content flow.

## Gates
- Every step: `local_ci.sh --task` green, headless test with numbers, replay hash stable, existing scenes unchanged (opt-in per component).
- A1 states a budget per target; later steps stay inside it.
- Every content file in the repo or a fetch script has a recorded licence (D2 ledger); no non-redistributable assets.
